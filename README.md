# Estimation of foulant rejection, pure water flux and flux recovery

Intallation: If you have already installed MATLAB 2019b or a newer version on your computer, just run the Estimation.exe. Otherwise, please run Estimation_Installer.exe.

The GUI platform was made of the best 30 ANN models for each output and the results were plotted as an average of the outputs of the ANN models. The user can insert the values of polymer type, polymer concentration, average filler size, solvent type, solvent concentration, and contact angle, and then the estimation of solute rejection, pure water flux, and flux recovery are plotted versus the filler concentration of 0 to 1 with 0.1 increments (totally 11 points for each output in every run). As the users push the Run & Save button, three plots are depicted and an excel file is produced for saving the results of the three figures.
